    name: 'Ben',
    bio: "My name is Ben. No last name. No middle name. I was the eighth child to be born into the noble house of Manley. I should have been named Ben Manley at the very least but no, this life was taken from me. My birth country, the Republic of Texas, forbid the birth of eight children. Seven was the limit since the secession from the Union the eighth son had made on one of the kings ages past. Each family was allowed four boys and three girls. My family being of notable power and wealth was spared the ordeal of having me killed... as long as they wiped me out of their family logs and rejected my connection to them. I was to be sent to the orphanage to be brought up as a peasant. I wasn't. Instead my 'family' took me as a 'servant'. I was treated worse than the dogs. I had to teach myself to read and write, how to hunt, and how to kill. When I was eight one of my four brothers died, stuck down in combat. But still I was denied my birthright. My mother was pregnant with my little 'brother'. The brat was given my birthright, my heritage, MY FAMILY. I was treated like dirt never knowing why. When I reached the age of seventeen I learned. I learned of my past. It was a slip of the tongue from my drunken eldest brother. I was enraged, but I concealed it. showing my intelligence had gotten me more than a few beatings before. When night had fallen I struck. I had slain my eldest brothers, and my three sisters before they knew what was happening. My mother, father, and my little brother, with three guards stood before me and my revenge. I quickly slew the guards. I have to admit Manleys are the best swordsmen alive. My father being a sturdy man heading past his prime was still a difficult challenge, but they revealed their secrets to me. Their best moves, their fatal flaws, it's terrifying what one reveals to those they believe beneath them. I slew my father and the look of defeat on his face was one I will savor for eternity. I coldly dispatched my mother, but spared the scum I called a brother. He was only nine and no it wasn't some twisted morality that made me spare him. It was the fact that it would be so much more...enjoyable to kill him when he was older. I left him with the parting words, 'Survive little brother, and maybe you'll avenge these deaths.' I took some money and my fathers prized sword. A long sword with a silver sheen. The hilt had a diamond pommel and it was perfectly balanced. Only a Manley could wield it and it was the final nail in the coffin of my past when I didn't die touching it. I live as an adventure now and I hope to one day meet my little brother again....so I may finish what I started.",

    name: 'Hunter Long',
    bio: 'I was taken in by an expert at a young age; maybe a powerful wizard, or some renowned fighter. Accepted as an apprentice, I lived and learned with this master, with my eyes set on becoming just as great as them. However, while investigating a powerful magic object with me close by, they touched the item and immediately vanished. Though the item remained, there was no trace of my master. Uncertain of what to do, I chose not to touch the item myself, instead continuing with my studies as best I could from the books and journals they left behind. Someday I intend to find out what really happened, and where Shazad went, but I know now that magic must always be used with great caution and uncertainty. I will not make the same mistakes my master did.',

    name: 'Joe',
    bio: "At a young age my home city was overrun. I wasn’t sure if the attackers destroyed it, but my family was forced to flee along with many others before the battle began. I travelled far outside my home country, continuing even further than those I began the journey with. Where my family finally settled, there was none of my kind; I stood out, and people had many questions. My parents grew old, and the experience jaded them. They spoke of my homeland as being a wonderful place of prosperity and happiness, and though they longed to return, they refused to make the difficult trek back. I, however, have decided that I will go back and search for the remains of my family’s past. I’ve learned that the old city is home now to some evil, and so I must train and prepare for this dangerous task.",
